Welcome to my website. This contains my CV, publications, and some other useful information about me.

Starting in 2020 September, I will be a Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Davis, working on transportation policy issues at the Institute of Transportation Studies along with the Policy Institute. Previously, I got my bachelor's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014, majoring in physics and minoring in economics, and my master's and PhD degrees at Princeton University respectively in 2016 and 2020, in electrical engineering; my graduate research was about theoretical analysis of models and limits to fluctuational electromagnetic phenomena, including van der Waals/Casimir forces as well as thermal radiation powers.
