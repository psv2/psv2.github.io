Welcome to my website. This contains my CV, publications, and some other useful information about me.

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS-Davis), having started in 2020 September, and am also affiliated with the University of California, Davis, Policy Institute for Energy, Environment, and the Economy; my tenure of the University of California, Davis Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship runs from 2020 September through 2022 August. At ITS-Davis, I work on improving understanding of transportation challenges facing people with disabilities in the United States, and I have been involved in ongoing policy debates about transportation policy for people with disabilities at the national level and in California. Previously, I got my bachelor's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014, majoring in physics and minoring in economics. I got my master's and PhD degrees at Princeton University respectively in 2016 and 2020, in electrical engineering; my graduate research was about theoretical analysis of models and limits to fluctuational electromagnetic phenomena, including van der Waals/Casimir forces as well as thermal radiation powers.
