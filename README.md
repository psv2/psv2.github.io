## Career 2: Transportation Researcher

I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS-Davis) between 2020 September and 2024 June. While it existed, I was also affiliated with the University of California, Davis, Policy Institute for Energy, Environment, and the Economy. My tenure of the University of California, Davis Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellowship ran from 2020 September through 2022 August. At ITS-Davis, I worked on the following four topics and developed the skills including but not limited to those listed below.

Separately, after I finished my job at ITS-Davis and around the time that I started my job at Cambridge Systematics, I was hired as a contract researcher by the National Council on Disability for a few months in 2024. My contributions entered their [report about transportation & disability](https://www.ncd.gov/report/ground-transportation-for-people-with-mobility-disabilities-2025-challenges-and-progress/) that was published in 2025.

### Topics

- Travel behavior of people with disabilities (principal investigator, awarded 2 grants from UC Davis via Caltrans/US DOT/Pacific Southwest Region UTC funding)
- Travel behavior of road collision survivors (principal investigator, awarded 2 grants from UC Davis via California SB 1 funding)
- ADA obligations of ridehailing companies (contributor)
- Best practices for equitable and accessible autonomous vehicle policymaking (contributor)

### Skills

- Advising 2 graduate students
- Writing, winning, and managing research grants as a principal investigator
- Obtaining Institutional Review Board approval for human subjects research
- Designing questionnaires for, coordinating, conducting, and analyzing quantitative & qualitative data from online surveys, virtual focus groups, and virtual stakeholder interviews
- Engagement with dozens of community-based organizations representing people with disabilities & other marginalized groups

### Academic achievements

- 4 peer-reviewed journal articles
- 5 invited talks
- 6 contributed talks

## Career 1: Physicist

I got my bachelor's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2014, majoring in physics and minoring in economics. I got my master's and PhD degrees at Princeton University respectively in 2016 and 2020, in electrical engineering. My graduate research was about the following topics and led me to develop the following skills.

### Topics

- Development of theoretical frameworks, numerical models, and numerical methods to compute van der Waals/Casimir forces as well as thermal radiation powers involving atom-scale molecular objects in proximity with continuum macroscopic objects ([see AARMBEM.jl](https://psv2.github.io/AARMBEM.jl/))
- Derivation of tighter theoretical limits on radiative heat transfer, thermal emission, phonon conductive heat transfer, and combined phonon conductive-radiative heat transfer covering size range from dipolar to macroscopic objects

### Skills from graduate school

- Linear electromagnetic theory, including semiclassical & fluctuational electromagnetic theory
- Quantum physics
- Phonons in the linear regime
- Linear algebra
- Numerical analysis
- Scientific computing in Julia, including parallelization
- Making graphs using PyPlot
- Mentoring 3 undergraduate students
- Technical writing
- Technical presentations

### Academic achievements

- 12 peer-reviewed journal articles
- 2 invited talks
- 3 contributed talks
- National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow
- 4 departmental awards in graduate school
